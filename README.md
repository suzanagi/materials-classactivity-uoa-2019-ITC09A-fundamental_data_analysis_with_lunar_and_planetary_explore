# ITC09A Fundamental Data Analysis with Lunar and Planetary Explorations
Almost all mateials I've used in ITC09A.

## Attention
Please understand some large-size files or meaningless images just for submission are ommitted. 
Especially the cspice toolkit files and kernels in the SPICE_tutorial folder are intentionally deleted before upload.
You can download cspice library at [the official website](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html) and kernels used in the class are distributed every year.
I don't upload them because the file sizes are too large and it may infringe the cooperator's rights.
